# **Quote Server with Load Balancing using Docker Compose and HAProxy**

This project demonstrates how to create a **load-balanced multi-container application** using:
- **.NET Core C#** for the Quote Server
- **Python** for the Quote Client
- **HAProxy** as the load balancer
- **Docker Compose** to manage multi-container setup

```

---

## **Build and Run the Server**

### 1. **Build Docker Images using Docker Compose**
**Command:**
```bash
docker-compose build
```

**Sample Output:**
```
[+] Building 3/3
 âœ” quote-server-1 Built
 âœ” quote-server-2 Built
 âœ” quote-server-3 Built
```

---

### 2. **Start the Server Containers**
**Command:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Sample Output:**
```
[+] Running 5/5
 âœ” Network quote-network Created
 âœ” Container quote-server-1 Started
 âœ” Container quote-server-2 Started
 âœ” Container quote-server-3 Started
 âœ” Container haproxy Started
```

---

## **Build and Run the Client**

### 1. **Build Client Docker Image**
**Command:**
```bash
docker build -t quote-client .
```

**Sample Output:**
```
[+] Building 0.6s (9/9) FINISHED
 âœ” quote-client Built
```

### 2. **Run the Client Container**
**Command:**
```bash
docker run -it --name quote-client --network quote-network quote-client
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter a quote number (1-10) or 0 to exit: 1

## **Troubleshooting**

### 1. **Error: Network already exists**
**Solution:**
```bash
docker network rm quote-network
```

### 2. **Error: Connection Refused**
**Solution:**
- Ensure all containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```
- Check HAProxy logs:
```bash
docker logs haproxy
```

---

## **Clean Up**
**Command:**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker network rm quote-network
```
